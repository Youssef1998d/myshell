# shell with python


Challenge : Recreation of a shell in python without using the [`cmd`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html) module.

Proposition : Program will search for the process, wait for its execution, and then reading its output.

## Usage

There are interactive mode (like cmd) and batch mode (executes commands in file).

## Python

The core code is all about the class `CMD`, user can enter the name of the file containing wished commands and the mode (file is only mandatory for batch mode)).
